Levels 2 & 3 are platformer based levels. This means that there are platforms you can jump on to. The objective of these levels are to collect the collectibles, coins for level 2 and stars for level 3. Upon collecting a coin or star, a prompt will open, and you will have to choose the correct choices to gain coins (in level 2) or stars (in level 3).
